# 👋 Hi, I'm Radmehr

🎓 I'm currently completing an LLM in Law & Finance at the University of Amsterdam and law and technology at Tilburg University, where I combine a strong legal foundation with an interest in finance, technology, and data.

💼 I'm passionate about the intersection of law, finance, and code — especially in areas like , financial regulation, ESG transparency, and decentralised finance.

📚 I started coding in middle school with small projects for fun. Now I mostly enjoy building tools to explore legal-financial data, clean documents, and experiment with natural language processing (NLP).
